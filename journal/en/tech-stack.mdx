# Update

In the recent update, a new section "Stack" appeared, which consists of the `<TechStack />` component.

<DynamicImage
  className="rounded-xl !relative overflow-hidden border"
  image={{
    dark: "/tech-stack/grid_dark.png",
    light: "/tech-stack/grid_light.png"
  }}
  alt="tech-stack-grid"
/>

It seemed to me that the main page was missing a section with the technologies I use in development, so I started working on it. When looking for a design for the new block, I remembered a design I had seen on the [Vercel homepage](<https://vercel.com/home>), so I took it as a basis and adapted it to my site.

When hovering over any block, except for the double one, the icon is highlighted and triggers the name display in the double block.

<TechStack title="Double Block" />

The component takes an array that contains information about the stack, for which I created the Stack type.

```
type Stack = {
  label: string
  value: string
  icon: ReactNode
  color?: string
  y: number
}
```
Sequential highlighting of the stack was implemented, for this the `<AutoSwitcher />` component was developed.

```
<AutoSwitcher
  stop={stop} // To stop switching
  index={index} // Current index
  maxIndex={maxIndex} // Last index, so as not to go out of bounds
  onIndex={onIndex} // To update the current index
/>
```


```
<Wrapper className="w-full grid lg:grid-cols-4 grid-cols-2 grid-rows-3 lg:grid-rows-2"
  onEnter={() => {
    setIsOut(false)
  }}
  onLeave={() => {
    setSelected(null)
    setIsOut(true)
  }}
>
  <AutoSwitcher stop={!isOut} index={index} maxIndex={maxIndex} onIndex={setIndex} />
  <Header title={title}>
    <HeaderList y={y} selected={selected} stack={stack} />
  </Header>
  {
    stack
      .map(
        (item, techIndex) => {
          const isSelected = techIndex === index
          return (
            <Item
              key={"tech#" + techIndex}
              stack={item}
              onChange={setSelected}
              className={isAutoMode ? isSelected ? icon["active-icon"] : "" : icon["icon-wrapper"]}
            />
          )
        }
      )
  }
</Wrapper>
```
One of the most interesting things was creating the icons; I was inspired by their appearance on the [Vercel homepage](<https://vercel.com/home>). I drew the icons manually in Figma and then transferred them as SVG to the code.

<DynamicImage
  className="rounded-xl !relative overflow-hidden border"
  image={{
    dark: "/tech-stack/icons_figma.png",
    light: "/tech-stack/icons_figma.png"
  }}
  alt="tech-stack-grid"
/>

Thank you for your attention, that's all!
