# Update

In the recent update, a new section "Stack" appeared, which consists of the `<TechStack />` component.

<DynamicImage
  className="rounded-xl !relative overflow-hidden border"
  image={{
    dark: "/tech-stack/grid_dark.png",
    light: "/tech-stack/grid_light.png"
  }}
  alt="tech-stack-grid"
/>

I felt that the main page was missing a section with the technologies I use in development, so I set out to develop it.
While searching for a design for the new block, I remembered a design I had seen on the [Vercel homepage](<https://vercel.com/home>), so I took it as a basis and adapted it for my site.

<TechStack />

When hovering over any block, except the double one, the icon is highlighted and triggers the display of the name in the double block.
One of the most interesting parts was creating the icons; I was inspired by their appearance on the [Vercel homepage](<https://vercel.com/home>).
I drew the icons manually in Figma and then transferred them as SVG into the code.

<DynamicImage
  className="rounded-xl !relative overflow-hidden border"
  image={{
    dark: "/tech-stack/icons_figma.png",
    light: "/tech-stack/icons_figma.png"
  }}
  alt="tech-stack-grid"
/>

Thank you for your attention, that's all for now!
